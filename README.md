# Continuous Delivery Environment - Toolsmith
To setup a continuous delivery environment could be an awkward job. The present GIT repository should help in setting up an continuous delivery environment based on ``docker``.

## Prepare the environment

### Prerequisites
Install ```docker```and ```docker-compose``` in your environment. You will find both software artefacts at: http://www.docker.com. Depending on the base plattform you are using it is much simpler to use the packet manager at hand e.g. in MacOSX for a local installation ```homebrew``` would be a reasonable choice. ```git``` and ```bash```is another requirement you need to fulfill.

### Bootstrap the environment
Start a terminal / shell and clone the present GIT repository to your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/amarkwalder/toolsmith.git
```
